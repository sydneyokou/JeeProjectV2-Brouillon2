Before you launch the project, you will need to import the sql files located in the folder WebPages/WEB-INF/requeteSQL. 
You will have to go in Services > DataBases > Right click on Java DB > Create Data base. 
Your database should be named PROJET and your credentials are "jee" for both user and password.
